  <li><b>Introduction</b><br>
As described elsewhere the Travelling Salesman Problem is a problem
that can't be solved in polynomial time. This paper describes a genetic
algorithm to find approximate solutions to the problem. Genetic
solutions are solutions that follow an algorithm simillar to that
proposed for the genetic transformation in the evolution of species.
The idea is to combine "good" solutions to find more, hopefully better
solutions. In the evolutionary example the hope is that "good"
solutions are the more common ones. If they are more common, they are
more likely to combine or breed and produce more good solutions and
some better ones as well.
    <p> The travelling salesman problem is suited to this algorithm
particularly well because its easy to define "good", and its easy to
take two solutions and recombine them into a better solution. A good
solution, obviously, is a short one. Recombining two solutions is a
little more complicated than just slicing them and putting them back
together, but its close. You need to make sure each city is in the
resulting tour. </p>
    <p> Another whole twist is that there may be better solutions than
those present in the population. There may be a solution that is better
than the best combination of all the parts in the population. A
mutation is a random change that may or may not exist in any population
member. This algorithm uses two different mutation operations to
randomly introduce new combinations into the population. Details are in
the assigment. </p>
    <p> This particular implementation is written in Ruby, a newer
scripting language simillar to Perl and Python. I was amazed at how
easy and familliar it is to use. It was much easier than when I was
learning Perl. I think Ruby is easier than Perl because the syntax uses
less cryptic characters. It might just be that Ruby was easy for me
since I had already struggled with Perl. The Gui is written using Tk, a
toolkit used with Perl or another scripting language Tcl. </p>
    <p> <b> Observations </b><br>
I noticed, as suggested in the assignment, that without mutations, the
system finds a good solution rather quickly. It levels out almost
immediately. My graphs only go up to 500 generations,&nbsp; since the
code was written in Ruby. It runs slow. 500 generations took about 5
minutes. Without mutations, the bottom of the graph, the shortest
tour,&nbsp; was found rather quickly. With mutations, both kinds, the
bottom slowly drifts lower. While the tops of the mutated runs are
erratic and higher than the non mutated one, it seems the mutations
help a little bit. I need to let a mutated run go overnight and see how
well the slow improvement does.<br>
    <br>
The pictures below are screen shots of the Ruby/Tk application I wrote.
I got a little pressed for time trying to learn Tk from the numerous
Perl/Tk references on the web. Ruby instead of Perl is a small
challenge, but I look forward to a Ruby/Tk book, especially one with a
good description of layouts! The generation size graphs are lined
at&nbsp; full tour length units. The tour graph is a square with sides
of length one. (0, 0) is in the upper left corner.<br>
