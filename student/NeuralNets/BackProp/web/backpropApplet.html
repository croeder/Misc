</applet>
This is an applet for exploring a neural net built to
recognize circles. Train the network using the displayed
points by using the &quot;Train 200 Epochs&quot; button. If you click
the button a 2nd or 3rd time, it will train the network more.
Accuracy discovered during training is displayed on the graph
on the left. One training round consists of 200 epochs, or
1 pass through each of 200 points. A new set of points for a 
subsequent training round can be created using the 
&quot;New Training Set&quot; button.
<p>
At any time, the network can be tested using the 
&quot;Test 1000 points&quot; button. The points used to test
will be displayed on the right. Green means the network
&quot;thinks&quot; the point is inside the circle. Red
means it &quot;thinks&quot; its outside the circle. The
percentage of points it got correct are displayed at the
top of the applet. 
<p>
The three sliders at the bottom of the group of buttons 
control parameters of the network. Chaning one of these
parameters won't take effect until a new network is created.
<p>
The far right of the applet consists of a map of the network.
