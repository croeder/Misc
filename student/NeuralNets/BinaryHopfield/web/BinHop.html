<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project explores Binary Hopfield networks applied to the problems 
of pattern recognition, and noisy pattern recognition. 
<P>
A Java2 applet accompanies this project. It should run from your browser
if you have the Java2 plugin.<br>
Get the plugin <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin">here</a>.<br>
Go to the applet page <a href="BinHopApplet.html">here</a>.
Source code (java) includes the following files: 
<a href=BinHop.java>BinHop</a>, <a href=BinHopGui.java>BinHopGui</a>, 
<a href=Image.java>Image</a>.
<h3> Questions </h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Test each pattern</b><br>
  <ol>
  <li> The patterns converge in very few iterations, but they don't necessarily 
       converge to the desired patterns. Following are pictures after training
       on all four images. The patterns can be painted in large and small sizes.
       There are three different types of patterns. The first is an attempt at a
       &quot;normal&quot; numeral font. The second is based on 7 segment LEDs, and
       the last is just a set of simple, yet very different (at least in placement)
       symbols. None of the variations made a huge difference in the performance of
       the network. While the &quot;bits different&quot; display isn't working, the 
       differences in recognized pattern and what is/should be there is clearly  
       significant. The differences aren't just  a few random bits, but so much
       so that the original isn't recognizeable.
       <ul>
          <li><img src=smallzero.png>zero
          <li><img src=smallone.png>one
          <li><img src=smalltwo.png>two
          <li><img src=smallthree.png>three
      </ul>
      Here are pictures of other symbols. Each attempt at recognition was with a network
      trained on four symbols from that familly.
      <ul>
          <li><img src=largezero.png>
          <li><img src=largezero2.png>
          <li><img src=largeone2.png>
      </ul>
  </ol>
<li><b>Pattern Modification</b><br>
I tried a few different patterns. All stabilized very quickly. The display would go at least 
5 iterations, but would usually stabilize after one, or rarely two. I wondered if the 
7 segment numerals from LED displays would work any better because its always the same
segments that are recognized. Surprisingly, the were the least stable and the most
distorted. You can't see it from snapshots, but there are phases where the network
goes from completely white to completely black and back again. I also tried patterns
that aren't numbers, but just simple yet different patterns. It didn't work well
for them either. Following are some screen shots:
<ul>
<li> <img src=largeone3.png>
<li> <img src=largetwo3.png>
</ul>
<li><b>Noisy Tests</b><br>
This table shows the number of different bits for the various
images at various noise levels. These are 20x24 pixel images for a 
total of 480 pixels.
