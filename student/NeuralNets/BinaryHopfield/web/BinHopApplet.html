Applet Directions:
</b>
The network needs to be trained before it can recognize any characters.
The radio buttons on the left are for switching between training mode 
and character recognition mode. Training mode is initial set, so characters
can be added to the network by clicking their respective buttons. Watch the
connections graph on the right to see the effect of training.
<p>
Once trained, characters can be recognized. Set recoginition mode by choosing
the &quot;test&quot; radio button. Choose a character by clicking its button. Select a noise
level by moving the slider, and add noise by clicking the &quot;noise&quot; button. Finally,
attempt to recoginze the character by clicking on the &quot;recognize&quot; button.
<p>
The connections display is a bit crude and only shows the direction of the connections, 
not the magnitude. A horizontal bar shows a connection to the right and a vertical 
bar shows a connection to the neuron below.
