
A discussion of project 5 is in the file project5.doc.

From this directory, with java 1.4 installed, the executeables 
can be run from the command line in an MS-DOS prompt window
as follows:

project 2:
- java Display

project 3:
- java ZoneDemo

project 4:
- java SearchGrammar 

There are some issues with Display currently as it has taken 
a beating in past months and does nearly everything.
